===========
This is the Joomla! component that add the features to manage the Open-DAI environment (creates the VMs in CloudStack) and to deploy VDBs and APIs into the environment.

The tool is still in alpha stage and does not yet implement the API management.
Plan is to split some features present in this component into a second one (already present the GitHub repo) for better organization, but it will be done after the first release is finished

This is an admin only component and works for Joomla 3.3
